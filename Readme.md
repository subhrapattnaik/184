adding categories of frames filters. 


Users will be able to select frames to try on based on the category

Well, when we make categories of the product in an app, it helps users to easily find and browse the product they
are looking for and this is really to increase user experience using the app.

We distribute the frame based on the shape of the frame


We will be dividing them in five categories, regular, wayfarer,rimless, round, aviato

We will be adding the categories for the frames of glasses at the bottom of the screen in the Frames Container,just above the filter images
